# SinglePageJsGen

    With this project I wanted to display some basic website using a javaScript code where possible, instead of html. 
    All html structure is generated by singlePageGen.js file, and filled with content held in title and text arrays.
    The amount of 'boxes', each with title, image and text is based on the title array elements count.
    There is no check if amount of titles is equal to amount of images and text array elements, so be carefull.
    Maybe I will add this check in future.
    Written for further javaScript learning practice purposes.
